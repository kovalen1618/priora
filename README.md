## Extra Ideas

Create a sticky note component on the right side for users to place notes of things they need to do that don't have time settings

## CSS Modules (.module.css)

In React, CSS files with the .module.css extension are known as CSS modules. They provide a way to encapsulate styles and make them more scoped to the component they are associated with. This approach helps avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to manage styles in larger applications.

Here are a few reasons why people who use React choose to use CSS modules:

1. Scoping: CSS modules automatically generate unique class names for each component, ensuring that styles defined in one component do not interfere with styles in other components. This scoping mechanism helps prevent style collisions and provides a higher level of encapsulation.

2. Modularity: CSS modules promote modularity by allowing you to define styles directly in the component file or a separate .module.css file. This keeps the styles closely tied to the component code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

3. Explicitness: By importing styles from a CSS module, you have a clear and explicit dependency on those styles within the component. This improves the maintainability of your codebase since it's easy to identify which styles are being used in each component.

4. Local Overrides: CSS modules make it straightforward to override or extend styles for specific instances of a component. You can define local styles within a component file and selectively apply them to override or extend the styles defined in the module.

5. Build-time optimizations: Since CSS modules generate unique class names at build time, it enables tools like Webpack to perform optimizations like minification and dead code elimination specifically targeting the used styles. This can help reduce the overall CSS file size and improve application performance.
